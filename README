Here’s a breakdown of the named pins on the CC1101 module:

Pin	Typical Function / Notes
VCC	Power supply. Usually 3.3 V. Do not connect to 5 V directly — CC1101 is 3.3 V tolerant.
GND	Ground. Connect to Pico’s GND.
SCK	SPI Clock. Connect to your Pico’s SPI SCK pin.
MOSI	SPI Master-Out-Slave-In. Data from Pico → CC1101.
MISO	SPI Master-In-Slave-Out. Data from CC1101 → Pico.
CSN	SPI Chip Select (active low). Connect to a GPIO on the Pico for selecting the CC1101.
GDO0	This is a configurable digital output from the CC1101; often used to indicate packet received, sync detected, or for interrupts. You can connect this to a Pico GPIO to trigger captures.
GDO2	Another configurable digital output; can indicate sync, FIFO status, or carrier sense, depending on CC1101 config. Often optional.

Notes / tips:

GD00 is usually the pin you want for edge-triggered interrupts when receiving OOK packets.

GDO2 can sometimes be left unconnected if you only need basic RX.

CC1101 works best powered from 3.3 V, and all logic pins should be 3.3 V levels. If you use 5 V logic from a microcontroller, you’ll need a level shifter. Probably best to use 5v supply line on the Pico and use a buck convertor to produce 3.3v - to power the CC1101.
